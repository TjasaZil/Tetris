## Build with:

- [VUE.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - Javascript framework - used because I really like working with it and enjoy the workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework - used because I like working with it and it enables me to style components quickly, meaning I can use my time for other things that I find more important (like testing).
